        <h3>Physics and Computer Science at the University of Victoria</h3>
        <p>I grew up in love with physics and computers so it seemed like the obvious choice to pursue a combined major.</p>

      <div class="music">
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I've been playing music for quite a long time. Honestly I probably should be better at it.</p>

      <div class="web3">
        <h3>Web3</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately now due to pervasive greed 'blockchain' and 'web3' have become very divisive words. Proper use of such technologies still provides the best future for the democratization of digital goods and services. Following the industry since 2015. Full-Time Research Analyst: 2018-2021.

      <div class="speedrun">
        <h3>Speedrunning</h3>
        <p>Speedrunning has interested me for a couple years now however I never intended to do it myself. Using a game's code and hardware against itself always interested me and once I tried it myself I've fallen in. I can see doing more of this in the future. Currently 7th for Super Mario World 0-Exit.</p>
