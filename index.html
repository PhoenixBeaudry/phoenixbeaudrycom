      <h2>Projects</h2>

      <h3>Physics and Computer Science at the University of Victoria</h3>
      <p>I grew up enamoured with physics and computers so it seemed like the obvious choice to pursue a combined major. Now in my 3rd year.</p>

      <h3>Modular Synthesis</h3>
      <p>Perhaps it stems from my love of Physics, but the intricacies of modular synthesis have got a hold on me.</p>

      <h3>Ethereum and Blockchain</h3>
      <p>While fundamentally Blockchain is just a new data structure, and incredibly over hyped - the use cases for trustless, decentralized, immutable data storage is incredibly exciting.</p>


      <h3>3D Printing</h3>
      <p>A fairly new hobby. After stumbling upon some videos about 3D printing I quickly got sucked into its complexity.</p>

      <h3>Acting</h3>
      <p>Some say there is no thrill like being on stage in front of an audience, I'd agree. Its exhilarating and terrifying at the same time. And while I have not had the opportunity in awhile, it will always be a passion.</p>

      <h3>Speedrunning</h3>
      <p>Speedrunning has interested me for a couple years now however I never intended to do it myself. Using a game's code and hardware against <br>itself always interested me and once I tried it myself I've fallen in. I can see doing more of this in the future. Currently 4th in the world for Super Mario World 0-Exit.</p>
