        <h3>Physics and Computer Science at the University of Victoria</h3>
        <p>I grew up enamoured with physics and computers so it seemed like the obvious choice to pursue a combined major. The beauty in Physics, Math, and Computer Science is just as elegant as Music. Now in my 3rd year.</p>

      <div class="music">
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>There is this feeling in music that is otherworldly. As a musician you realize that learning music is exactly like learning a language. And what lovely stories people can tell each other.</p>

      <div class="web3">
        <h3>Web3</h3>
        <p>A paragraph long thesis: <br>
          ~1969 - ARPANET created. First TCP/IP network. <br>
          ~1990 - First Web Browser WorldWideWeb created. <br>
          ~2016 - Internet usage in developed countries reached 80% <br>
          Worldwide, Instant, High Bandwidth, Ubiquitous Communication has only existed for ~10 years. How long did people think it would take for clever people to come together and create a more optimal system?

        <h3>Book List</h3>
        <p>Sapiens - Yuval Harari <br>

      <div class="philosophy">
        <h3>Philosophy</h3>
        <p>For better or for worse, I am a <i>thinker</i>. Luckily that lead me to philosophy: a deep, meaningful and quite beautiful science that begins humbly when we admit that human existence is a pretty weird thing so let's try figure this all out.</p>

      <div class="speedrun">
        <h3>Speedrunning</h3>
        <p>Speedrunning has interested me for a couple years now however I never intended to do it myself. Using a game's code and hardware against itself always interested me and once I tried it myself I've fallen in. I can see doing more of this in the future. Currently 4th in the world for Super Mario World 0-Exit.</p>
